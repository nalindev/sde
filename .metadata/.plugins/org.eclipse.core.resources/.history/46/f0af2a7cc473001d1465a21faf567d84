 * Inheritance - it is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and
 * behaviour of it's parent object.
 * 
 *  In java inheritance are of 4 types -
 *  1. single inheritance - when a class inherits another class
 *  2. Multilevel inheritance - when there is a chain of inheritance
 *  3. Hierarchical inheritance - when two or more classes inherits a single class
 *	4. Hybrid inheritance - A hybrid inheritance is a combination of more then one type of inheritance.  	 
 *  
 *  Note - Multiple Inheritance are not supported in java through classes. we can use Interface for that.
